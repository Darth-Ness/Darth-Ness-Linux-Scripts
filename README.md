# Darth-Ness-Linux-Scripts
A repo of .sh files for the GNU/Linux OS

# Current Scripts
- pythonBuild.sh: compiles and runs python programs.
- rmGit.sh: Remove the files LICENSE, README.md, and .gitignore. Optionally it can also remove .git
- graphicChanger.sh: Changes GPU setting to either "High" or "Auto" WARNING: While "High" gives better preformance, it uses a lot of battery. Change your GPU setting back to "Auto" to save battery (Or the power bill) when you don't need it.
